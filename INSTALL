WeeChat Installation instructions
=================================

WeeChat can be built with cmake (recommended) or autotools.

[NOTE]
Only cmake is officially supported to build WeeChat. You should use autotools
only if you are not able to use cmake. +
Build with autotools requires more dependencies and is slower than with cmake.
