=== Compile

WeeChat can be built with http://cmake.org/[CMake] (recommended) or autotools.

[NOTE]
Only CMake is officially supported to build WeeChat. You should use autotools
only if you are not able to use CMake. +
Build with autotools requires more dependencies and is slower than with CMake.

----
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DPREFIX=/path/to/directory
$ make
$ make install     (as root for installation in system directories)
----

For more information or installation with autotools, please look at
http://weechat.org/files/doc/devel/weechat_user.en.html#compile_with_autotools[user's guide].
