# - Find Ruby
# This module finds if Ruby is installed and determines where the include files
# and libraries are. It also determines what the name of the library is. This
# code sets the following variables:
#
#  RUBY_EXECUTABLE   = full path to the ruby binary
#  RUBY_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where ruby.h can be found
#  RUBY_LIBRARY = path to where libruby.so* can be found

IF(RUBY_FOUND)
   # Already in cache, be silent
