/exec  -list
       [-sh|-nosh] [-bg|-nobg] [-stdin|-nostdin] [-buffer <name>] [-l|-o|-n|-nf] [-cl|-nocl] [-sw|-nosw] [-ln|-noln] [-flush|-noflush] [-color ansi|auto|irc|weechat|strip] [-rc|-norc] [-timeout <timeout>] [-name <name>] [-pipe <command>] [-hsignal <name>] <command>
       -in <id> <text>
       -inclose <id> [<text>]
       -signal <id> <signal>
       -kill <id>
       -killall
       -set <id> <property> <value>
       -del <id>|-all [<id>...]

   -list: list commands
     -sh: use the shell to execute the command (WARNING: use this option ONLY if all arguments are safe, see option -nosh)
   -nosh: do not use the shell to execute the command (required if the command has some unsafe data, for example the content of a message from another user) (default)
     -bg: run process in background: do not display process output neither return code (not compatible with options -o/-n)
   -nobg: catch process output and display return code (default)
  -stdin: create a pipe for sending data to the process (with /exec -in/-inclose)
-nostdin: do not create a pipe for stdin (default)
 -buffer: display/send output of command on this buffer (if the buffer is not found, a new buffer with name "exec.exec.xxx" is created)
      -l: display locally output of command on buffer (default)
      -o: send output of command to the buffer (not compatible with option -bg)
      -n: display output of command in a new buffer (not compatible with option -bg)
     -nf: display output of command in a new buffer with free content (no word-wrap, no limit on number of lines) (not compatible with option -bg)
     -cl: clear the new buffer before displaying output
   -nocl: append to the new buffer without clear (default)
     -sw: switch to the output buffer (default)
   -nosw: don't switch to the output buffer
     -ln: display line numbers (default in new buffer only)
   -noln: don't display line numbers
  -flush: display output of command in real time (default)
-noflush: display output of command after its end
  -color: action on ANSI colors in output:
             ansi: keep ANSI codes as-is
             auto: convert ANSI colors to WeeChat/IRC (default)
              irc: convert ANSI colors to IRC colors
          weechat: convert ANSI colors to WeeChat colors
            strip: remove ANSI colors
     -rc: display return code (default)
   -norc: don't display return code
-timeout: set a timeout for the command (in seconds)
   -name: set a name for the command (to name it later with /exec)
   -pipe: send the output to a WeeChat/plugin command (line by line); if there are spaces in command/arguments, enclose them with double quotes; variable $line is replaced by the line (by default the line is added after the command, separated by a space) (not compatible with options -bg/-o/-n)
-hsignal: send the output as a hsignal (to be used for example in a trigger) (not compatible with options -bg/-o/-n)
 command: the command to execute; if beginning with "url:", the shell is disabled and the content of URL is downloaded and sent as output
      id: command identifier: either its number or name (if set with "-name xxx")
     -in: send text on standard input of process
-inclose: same as -in, but stdin is closed after (and text is optional: without text, the stdin is just closed)
 -signal: send a signal to the process; the signal can be an integer or one of these names: hup, int, quit, kill, term, usr1, usr2
   -kill: alias of "-signal <id> kill"
-killall: kill all running processes
    -set: set a hook property (see function hook_set in plugin API reference)
property: hook property
   value: new value for hook property
    -del: delete a terminated command
    -all: delete all terminated commands

Default options can be set in the option exec.command.default_options.

Examples:
  /exec -n ls -l /tmp
  /exec -n ps xu | grep weechat
  /exec -n -norc url:http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=xxxxxxxx
  /exec -nf -noln links -dump http://weechat.org/files/doc/devel/weechat_user.en.html
  /exec -o uptime
  /exec -pipe "/print Machine uptime:" uptime
  /exec -n tail -f /var/log/messages
  /exec -kill 0
