** descrizione: `cipher used to crypt data (the number after algorithm is the size of the key in bits)`
** tipo: intero
** valori: aes128, aes192, aes256 (valore predefinito: `aes256`)

* [[option_sec.crypt.hash_algo]] *sec.crypt.hash_algo*

* [[option_sec.crypt.passphrase_file]] *sec.crypt.passphrase_file*
** descrizione: `path to a file containing the passphrase to encrypt/decrypt secured data; this option is used only when reading file sec.conf; only first line of file is used; this file is used only if the environment variable "WEECHAT_PASSPHRASE" is not set (the environment variable has higher priority); security note: it is recommended to keep this file readable only by you and store it outside WeeChat home (for example in your home); example: "~/.weechat-passphrase"`
